        <p>
        I am an undergraduate at Georgia Tech, majoring in computer science and minoring in physics. I got into coding through Roblox and have enjoyed solving the challenging problems that come with it. In my free time, I like working on <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregg_shorthand">Gregg shorthand</a> and the <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabolo">Chinese yoyo</a>. You'll also probably find me watching NASCAR on Sundays.
