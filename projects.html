                <h2>OnTrack</h2>

                Based on Truist Coach, OnTrack is an academic goal tracking app that also takes advantage of custom LLMs, created for GT's software engineering class. This is the first time we made it out of local host(!) as well as features much better user tracking and session support. It represents a pretty great picture of what I've been able to learn over the past year.

                <h2>The Caution Flag</h2>

                Submitted to <b>Hacklytics 2025,</b> this was aimed to be more a passion project, where our team tackled a challenge within something I am extremely interested in - NASCAR. This was also a chance for me to finally learn <b>PyTorch</b> correctly. We set out to see if we could proactively predict crashes that occur during NASCAR races. This was challenging for two reasons. First, NASCAR crashes are extremely hard to predict â€“ after all, the difference could be a single driver losing concentration for a millisecond. Second, NASCAR is extremely protective of their data, so we spent long hours watching race streams back to calibrate the timing data we could get. But we did it!

                <h2>Truist Coach</h2>

                Winning the Truist challenge track at <b>UGAHacks X,</b> this project combined a customized LLM with data visuals to provide users with financial guidance. I worked mainly on the backend, where I learned how to effectively <b>prompt engineer</b> GPT-4 to give customized responses. This was also my first taste of JavaScript, where I learned how to connect the frontend and backends of our projects using <b>Flask.</b> Overall, a great experience!

                <h2>Clarity</h2>

                This was my first hackathon with <b>HackGT 11</b>! We were able to win the Patient Safety Technology Challenge with this project. I will admit I was a little overwhelmed with the experience, but it served as my first exposure to many AI concepts and tools!
