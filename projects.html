                <h2>The Caution Flag</h2>

                Submitted to <b>Hacklytics 2025,</b> this was aimed to be more a passion project, where our team tackled a challenge within something I am extremely interested in - NASCAR. This was also a chance for me to finally learn <b>PyTorch</b> correctly. We set out to see if we could proactively predict crashes that occur during NASCAR races. This was challenging for two reasons. First, NASCAR crashes are extremely hard to predict â€“ after all, the difference could be a single driver losing concentration for a millisecond. Second, NASCAR is extremely protective of their data, so we spent long hours watching race streams back to calibrate the timing data we could get. But we did it!

                <h2>Truist Coach</h2>

                Winning the Truist challenge track at <b>UGAHacks X,</b> this project combined a customized LLM with data visuals to provide users with financial guidance. I worked mainly on the backend, where I learned how to effectively <b>prompt engineer</b> GPT-4 to give customized responses. This was also my first taste of JavaScript, where I learned how to connect the frontend and backends of our projects using <b>Flask.</b> Overall, a great experience!
