            Tales From Fall 2025 Recruiting
        </h1>
        <p>
            I’ve finally got some downtime after probably the busiest semester of my life. So I’d thought I’d write some thoughts about whatever tangentially relevant information occurred to me this Fall 2025. I found <a href = "https://oneraynyday.github.io/misc/2020/09/30/Interviewing-During-Covid/">this blog post</a> while preparing for an interview, so I’ll give some credit for inspiration, though I’ll likely share a bit more than just recruiting. I ended up accepting an offer from Hudson River Trading, if it’ll make you more likely to read through the rest of this text wall.
        </p>

        <h2>General Thoughts</h2>
        <p>
            Probably one of my biggest goals coming into this semester was landing a good internship. Personally, I was a bit …dissatisfied … with my 2024 recruiting season. Granted, I was able to land an internship at <a href = "https://www.gtri.gatech.edu">GTRI</a> (which I actually think helped a lot this cycle) as well as a first year. But I knew at least three hallmates who landed Amazon alone, so there was much to be desired. Of course, I recognized that this was probably not a normal experience, especially as they all were in the GT Stamps Scholarship Program, but it was still some subtle motivation, nevertheless. So, I told myself that I wouldn’t settle for anything less than a $60/hr SWE internship this year, since now I’d seen it was possible and I knew I had the skills to do it.

        <h2>Interviewing with BlackRock</h2>
        <p>
            I applied to BlackRock right as their application opened. You can select multiple tracks when you do so, so I applied for software engineering and quantitative investing. About a month later, I got a superday interview invite for Systematic Research within their Global Allocation fund, which basically does Quant Research. Quite honestly, I was surprised that a.) this team even existed and b.) I was matched for an interview. I think I did well on the interviews, but unfortunately, I didn’t get the offer. I was a bit disappointed, but it was still early in the recruiting season, so on I went…
        </p>

        <h2>Interviewing with Xantium</h2>
        <p>
            I applied for a quant developer role, which I actually have no intention of doing full-time, so I was probably a little underprepared for this. I actually think I did okay, given my abilities. But my abilities were clearly lacking. During the technical interview, I ran into a very <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXugs4B3lwU">interesting Python behavior</a> that I had no idea existed (which probably looks really bad for a QD role). That and I was clearly lacking architecture knowledge since my class hadn’t covered it yet. I probably wouldn’t have hired myself, and neither did Xantium.
        </p>

        <h2>Interviewing with Capital One</h2>
        <p>
            Capital One’s application closed within two days, so it was quite fortunate that I submitted one at all. I guess the takeaway from that is to really stop deliberating and stressing over a single application. After all, there are hundreds of good companies out there, and applying early seems to be a pretty big factor. As for me, I never really bothered with submitting cover letters, getting referrals, or tailoring my resume, so it’s probably not the most necessary. Anyways, I would guess the biggest hurdle with Capital One is their online assessment. I wouldn’t know, though, since I submitted another Code Signal GCA result in the portal. They basically encouraged it when they sent the invitation to take it, so I thought Why not? So if it drives home the point of not stressing over one application too much…
        </p>
        <p>
            I was then invited to participate in a “power day.” Based on Reddit sentiment, it was pretty clear that if you got the interview, you were probably getting the offer unless you fumbled heavily. I was also busy prepping for another interview, so it’s safe to say I put in just enough work not to fumble. And as it turns out, it was absolutely fine as I aced all the interviews and got the offer. Dare I say I was actually bored since they scheduled an hour break in the middle, but all the interviews ended up being half of their allotted time slot, so it ended up being about two hours of break for an hour of actual interviewing.
        </p>
        <p>
            This is also the one company I did some negotiating with. And by that, all I mean is I asked for an offer deadline extension. Georgia Tech’s Career Center posted a date that they recommend offers be valid until, and my recruiter was more than happy to honor that. It was a bit scary to ask, but it worked out!
        </p>

        <h2>D.E. Shaw Connect</h2>
        <p>
            Sometime during the summer, I got a pretty suspicious-looking email from a recruiter at D.E. Shaw to my school email. It was an invite to D.E. Shaw’s annual connect event, which is basically a night of free food with a bit of learning about the company on the side, all in New York City. I might have actually trashed the email, had I not noticed a “recruiter at D.E. Shaw” on my LinkedIn who-viewed-your-profile page a few weeks earlier. And of course, there was no saying no to a free vacation.
        </p>
        <p>
            I have to say, whatever LinkedIn sorcery they used was pretty accurate, since I was able to meet a few friends that I actually look up to. But surely LinkedIn couldn’t have been the only reason, since mine was actually in a decrepit state. I’ve seen one Reddit post (clearly I need better sources) hinting that they pull from school records, and that would make sense… Anyways, it was a great experience, and I would definitely recommend going if you’re invited!
        </p>

        <h2>HackMIT</h2>
        <p>
            I genuinely had a day to rest between coming back from Connect and flying out to Boston for HackMIT. Guess that had something to do with trying out my first-ever energy drink to pull my first all-nighter!
        </p>
        <p>
            I had never gone to a hackathon on this scale, so this was definitely an experience. First of all, just being in the same room with all the hackers was pretty cool, as all the hackathons I’ve been to have had most of the population migrate back to their dorms. Honestly, I wish I’d spent a little more time trying some of the mini events that were happening, too, but I became too engrossed in fixing all the bugs on my project. Oh well…
        </p>
        <p>
            Another really cool thing was the amount of sponsor interaction. At this point, I’d received my Capital One offer, so I wasn’t really interested in many of the companies, but I do know someone who was able to get multiple interviews just by talking to them. I did leave my resume off at two quant companies, however (subtle foreshadowing).
        </p>

        <h2>Interviewing with TikTok</h2>
        <p>
            I definitely goofed up this one. I actually didn’t full score the online assessment, but I think I did well enough, which is why I was invited to interview. With the amount of events I had happening, I was bound to schedule something wrong, and unfortunately, I didn’t realize I scheduled the interview on top of D.E. Shaw Connect, until it was probably too late.This wasn’t even the last time this happened, as I would make two more scheduling mistakes this season, though none as catastrophic as this one. I have since consolidated all my events into a Google Calendar to ensure this never happens again.
        </p>
        <p>
            My recruiter took until about 2 hours before my originally scheduled time to confirm the reschedule, so I definitely spent some time stressing about this in the hotel room before Connect. It was a moot point, though, since I received my Capital One offer only a day later. I ended up doing the interview and doing pretty well, but as of November 2025, I have not heard a pipsqueak back, most likely for headcount reasons. You win some, you lose some…
        </p>

        <h2>Interviewing with Hudson River Trading</h2>
        <p>
            Concurrently with basically everything above, I was in the process of interviewing with Hudson River Trading. Honestly, I had such low expectations for this process that it didn’t even hit me that it was possible until I walked out of my superday interview. Not to say I didn’t study my butt off for it. I vividly remember finishing the last chapter of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Designing-Data-Intensive-Applications-Reliable-Maintainable/dp/1449373321/">Designing Data-Intensive Applications</a> on the plane ride to New York. I don’t want to stray too close to confidential information, but for advice, I thought that <a href="https://www.hudsonrivertrading.com/hrtbeat/interview-at-hrt/">this blog post</a> provides some good pointers.
        </p>
        <p>
            In any case, I’m not sure I can provide much more solid advice at all, since I am suffering from a little impostor syndrome. But, HRT invited me back to New York for an offer party, where I was able to talk with some full-timers, and I learned a lot more about the company and the fact that the work-life balance is actually pretty good. That and a steady trickle of free merch and snack surprises have gotten me pretty excited about working in New York this summer.
        </p>

        <h2>Interviewing with Voloridge</h2>
        <p>
            Apparently, Voloridge is one of the hardest firms to pass the resume screen. There’s some consensus within the TQD Discord server that you have to live in Florida to pass it. Who knows? But where I live, we’re known for peaches and not oranges. I didn’t even submit a resume, actually. At least not through an application form. Voloridge was one of two companies I bothered talking to at HackMIT, and somehow they were able to make an immaculate scan of the resume I dropped off. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The process I was in was kind of convoluted since I was shuffled through a few different roles to interview for. Eventually, it dragged on too long, and I declined further interviews as I had accepted HRT by that point. Speaking to my interviewers, I could pick up that it was a pretty cool culture, though. And if there was ever an example of an unconventional way of landing an interview, it’s Voloridge.
        </p>

        <h2>Joining GT Dragonflyers</h2>
        <p>
            I ended up hopping on four free round-trip flights this year (three to New York!), which is quite astonishing, actually. But closer to home, I had the chance to join Georgia Tech’s <a href="https://www.instagram.com/gt_dragonflyers/">Chinese yoyo team</a>, which might be the highlight of the weekends that I was in Georgia. We ended up performing at UGA and Emory and had multiple outings all the way out to Duluth. I’m quite happy I was roped into doing this!
        </p>

        <h2>Closing Thoughts</h2>
        <p>
            I definitely didn’t have the smoothest recruiting cycle (no FAANG interviews at all), and I’d say there was luck involved in ending up where I did. Given that, I’m not sure I’m in a position to offer any sappy remarks, but hopefully you can learn from my experiences.
